/*

1. ======================== note ==============
*** The JavaScript engine first reads the code, and then runs it. The errors that occur on the reading phase are called “parse-time” errors and are unrecoverable (from inside that code). That’s because the engine can’t understand the code.
    thats why try..catch can only handle errors that occur in valid code. Such errors are called “runtime errors” or, sometimes, “exceptions”.






    
2. ============== type =============
try {
  
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
